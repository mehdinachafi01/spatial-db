# Spatial Databases - Practical Work Overview

## Introduction
This practical work introduces Spatial SQL, a powerful extension of SQL for managing and querying spatial data. By utilizing tools like PostGIS (a spatial extension for PostgreSQL) and QGIS, this tutorial demonstrates how spatial data can be stored, processed, and analyzed. Spatial SQL facilitates operations such as distance calculations, proximity analysis, and spatial joins, which are integral to Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and various real-world applications like urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring.

## TD-1: Installing PostGIS and Setting Up a Spatial Database
- Install PostgreSQL along with the PostGIS extension.
- Create a spatial database using pgAdmin.
- Verify the PostGIS installation and setup.

## TD-2: Creating Spatial Tables
- Create spatial tables with various geometry types (Point, Polygon, and LineString).
- Insert spatial data into these tables using QGIS.
- Validate the inserted data with SQL queries.

## TD-3: Performing Advanced Spatial Queries with PostGIS
- Learn spatial queries and operations in PostGIS.
- Execute queries to analyze spatial relationships and perform geometric computations.
- Explore spatial joins and proximity-based queries.
